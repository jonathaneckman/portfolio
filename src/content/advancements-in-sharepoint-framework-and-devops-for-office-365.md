In my latest blog post I describe how you can enable successful DevOps practices by taking advantage of advancements made in the SharePoint Framework and O365. Manage your O365 configuration as code, add test automation to your SharePoint Framework solution, and deploy it all to test, staging, and production environments with a Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Check it out [on the Applied Information Science's website](https://www.appliedis.com/advancements-in-sharepoint-framework-and-devops-for-office-365/).
